  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-trimoxazole is a sulfonamide-containing antibiotic that is effective in the treatment of several infections and for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. This drug has been reported as a common culprit drug for the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and for toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play a key role in the immunopathogenesis of severe cutaneous reactions induced by several drugs. This study investigated the association between the HLA class I and HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms and co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN in a Thai population.
METHODS: Forty-three patients with co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN and 91 co-trimoxazole-tolerant patients were enrolled in the study. HLA class I and HLA-DRB1 were genotyped using the reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe method.
RESULTS: The frequencies of three alleles of HLA, namely HLA-B*15:02, HLA-C*06:02, and HLA-C*08:01, were significantly higher in the co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN group compared with controls. The risks for co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN in patients with the HLA-B*15:02, HLA-C*06:02, or HLA-C*08:01 allele were about 3-11-fold higher when compared with those who did not carry one of these alleles. Individuals who carried the HLA-B*15:02-C*08:01 haplotype had a 14-fold higher risk for co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN.
CONCLUSION: Evidence of associations between co-trimoxazole-induced SJS/TEN and HLA alleles including HLA-B*15:02, HLA-C*06:02, and HLA-C*08:01 were found in the study population. These findings may suggest that apart from the HLA molecules, other molecules involved in the molecular pathogenesis of these severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions may play an important role in the susceptibility of individuals to SJS/TEN caused by co-trimoxazole.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Investigations have highlighted the lack of evidence regarding the likelihood of congenital malformations following exposure to antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy. To gain further knowledge regarding their safety, we evaluated signals of congenital malformations with antipsychotics using VigiBase(\textregistered), the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database.
METHOD: A case/non-case study was conducted in VigiBase(\textregistered) between 1967 and 2014. Signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) were detected using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), which defines SDRs as drug-report associations with a PRR $\geq$2, Chi square $\geq$4, and number of cases $\geq$3. SDR detection for antipsychotics was performed for congenital malformations after removing all reports related to drug competitors and reports of movement disorders from the database.
RESULTS: After removing reports related to drug competitors (antiepileptics, antidepressants, antivirals) and movement disorders, three signals were revealed: 'palate disorders congenital' (PRR 2.1, 95~\% CI 1.6-2.9, Chi square~=~30; n~=~41), 'oesophageal disorders congenital' (PRR 2.5, 95~\% CI 1.3-4.7, Chi square~=~11; n~=~10) and 'anorectal disorders congenital' (PRR 3.0, 95~\% CI 1.6-5.6, Chi square~=~13; n~=~11). Among antipsychotics, phenothiazines with a piperazine side-chain, risperidone and aripiprazole appeared to be more suspect.
CONCLUSION: Confirming a first signal from spontaneous reporting data, three SDRs for antipsychotics and gastrointestinal congenital abnormalities were unmasked in VigiBase(\textregistered). This signal should be further explored by ad hoc pharmacoepidemiologic studies in order to assess whether it is relevant for prescription and public health.},
